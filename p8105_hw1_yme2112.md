Loading necessary data set from “moderndive” package

``` r
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Let’s take a look at the data

``` r
View(early_january_weather)
nrow(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 358

``` r
ncol(early_january_weather)
```

    ## [1] 15

``` r
mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

    ## [1] 39.58212

This data shows the weather data for EWR airport in January of 2013 with
15 variables found in `ncol(early_january_weather)` and 358 entries from
`nrow(early_january_weather)`. Important variables `time_hour`(date and
hour) ,`temp`(temperature in F), `precip` (precipitation in inches),
help determine environmental conditions in the hour. The mean
temperature is 39.58F as said in `mean(early_january_weather$temp)`.

## Let’s make a scatter plot and save it

``` r
january_plot = ggplot(data = early_january_weather,
       aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point()

ggsave("january_scatterplot.png", plot = january_plot)
```

    ## Saving 7 x 5 in image

From what we can see, after January 10th there were more instances of
humidity. Most of the humid days occurred when the temp was between 40
and 50F.

## Let’s do Problem 2

``` r
problem_df =
  tibble(
    vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
    vec_logic = vec_numeric > 0, 
    vec_length = sample(c("red","yellow","blue"), size = 10, replace = TRUE),
    vec_factor = factor(sample(c("low", "medium", "high"), size = 10, replace = TRUE))
  )
```

now, lets find the mean and try out our new pipe function we learned!

``` r
mean(problem_df|> pull(vec_numeric))
```

    ## [1] 0.1557695

``` r
mean(pull(problem_df,vec_logic))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(problem_df |> pull(vec_length))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem_df, vec_length)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(problem_df |> pull(vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(problem_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric
    ## or logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The last two vectors labled as `vec_factor` and `vec_length` are not
numerically based, but character based and that’s why there is no mean.

``` r
num_logic = as.numeric(problem_df |> pull(vec_logic))
num_length = as.numeric(problem_df |> pull(vec_length))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
num_factor = as.numeric(problem_df |> pull(vec_factor))
```

`num_length` comes up as an error. Character means cannot be found
because it is text. However, the `num_factor` came up as an error in
mean but not `as.numeric` which is because in the background, R
transforms these factor labels into numbers that represent them.
